# React Material Dashboard Starter

Minimal [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) project for those how are beginners and want a starter template that is simple
and functional. Also are the use of [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) 
for routing management.

## Other cool stuff that were used:

##### 2- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for designed components.
##### 3- [MUI Treasury](https://mui-treasury.com/) for pre-build layouts.
